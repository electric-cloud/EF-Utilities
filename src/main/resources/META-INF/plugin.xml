  <detailedDescription>The EC-Utilities  plugin provides CloudBees CD procedures you can use to perform the following operations:

    * Decommission environments: This procedure allows users to create a process step easily using utility procedure which will tear down all the dynamically created environments. This procedure can work in the context of either Pipeline or a Job (Process or Procedure).
    * Create a schedule to trigger gate: This procedure allows users to
    create a stage gate that is triggered by a schedule. The idea is to
    prevent a stage to start before a specific date and time.
